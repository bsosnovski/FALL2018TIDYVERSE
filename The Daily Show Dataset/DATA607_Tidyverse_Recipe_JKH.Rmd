##DATA 607 - Tidyverse Recipes 

###Tidy The Daily Show Dataset


In this recipe, we will clean a FiveThirtyEight.com dataset behind an article on Jon Stewart's final show listing all of the guests that he had on the show, [Every Guest Jon Stewart Ever Had On 'The Daily Show'](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-guest-jon-stewart-ever-had-on-the-daily-show/)

The dataset was downloaded from this Github repository:

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/daily-show-guests)

![Dataset Explained](DailyShowDataset.PNG)

####Load the Dataset
```{r}
daily_show_guests <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/daily-show-guests/daily_show_guests.csv')


```


####Exploratory Analysis

The dataset consists of 2,693 observations and five variables, "Year", "GoogleKnowlege_Occupation" (a Google determination of the guest's occupation), ""Date the Show Aired","Show" (date that the show aired), "Group", and "Raw_Guest_List" (taken from Wikipedia).


```{r}
dim(daily_show_guests)
```



#####1. Variable Names
Variable names need to be updated to better reflect the data.

```{r}
names(daily_show_guests)
```


#####2. GoogleKnowlege_Occupation
GoogleKnowlege_Occupation shows a considerable number of errors, mis-spellings, title case errors. etc.

```{r}
GoogleKnowlege_Occupation <- daily_show_guests %>% 
              group_by(GoogleKnowlege_Occupation) %>% 
              summarise(n = n())

head(GoogleKnowlege_Occupation, 10)
```



#####3. Group

```{r}
Category <- daily_show_guests %>% 
              group_by(Group) %>% 
              summarise(n = n())
Category


```


####Recipe Steps:

1. Change the variable names to improve the accurarcy of what it's capturing.
2. Delete rows where "Group" is NA which means that there was no guest.
3. Convert the Occupation variable to Title case and correct mis-spellings of each title
4. Conform the Group data to more distinct categories, i.e. "Political Aide" and "Politician" should be "Politics".

                            filter(!is.na(Category) ) %>%

```{r}

####Suggestions for further cleaning:
1. Update the Misc
2. Unnest the names. Some of the Guest values are multi-entry.
3. Add a frequency variable.


```{r}
new_daily_show_df[new_daily_show_df$Category == "Misc",]
```
